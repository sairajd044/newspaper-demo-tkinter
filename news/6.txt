England all-rounder Ben Stokes has said he never asked umpires to not award England six overthrows in final over of 2019 World Cup final. "I went straight to Tom Latham and said 'Mate, I'm so sorry', looked over to Kane Williamson and said 'I'm sorry'," he added. Pacer James Anderson earlier claimed Stokes had asked for overthrows to be cancelled.
