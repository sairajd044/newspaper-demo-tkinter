Speaking about labelling films, Sonakshi Sinha said, "I just want this whole thing of calling a film led by a female artiste 'woman centric' to go away." "When an Akshay Kumar or a Salman Khan does a film, no one calls it a male-centric film," she added. "A film is a film. Period. We should stop categorising them," said Sonakshi.
